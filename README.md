# Vector_field

## Context

This mini project is part of the course "Specific mathematics" of my second year of Bachelor at HE-Arc Ing√©nierie. The goal of this project is to generate a vector field from one or more vectors input by the user. Once the vector field is generated, we can add points to see the effect the field has on the direction of the point.

This project is written in JavaScript and uses the library p5.js to generate the vector field and the points.

There are 3 of us who worked on this project :
- Jan Steiner
- David Crevoiserat
- Anasse El boudiri (me)

## Getting Started

If you want to try this project, you just have to clone the repository and run the file `script/AN2022_MiniProjet_EqA1.html` in your browser.

After that you just have to draw some vectors and press the button "Calcul" to generate the vector field. Then you can add points (by checking the box "Add points") and see the effect of the vector field on the direction of the points (by press the button "run").

NB : This project is very simple and not really user friendly. It was made for a school project and not for a real use. Enjoy !
